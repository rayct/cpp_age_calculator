# This program will prompt the user for their date of birth, and then it will calculate current age, the day of the week you were born on, and the number of days until your next birthday.

## To use the program, simply run it in a C++ environment and follow the prompts.

# Version: 1.0.2
## This optimised version of the program uses references instead of copies of tm structs,
## avoids unnecessary calculations using std::chrono,
## ses string literals instead of creating std::string objects from char arrays, and uses const where appropriate.

# Version: 1.0
## In this version of the program, we've made use of the ctime and chrono libraries to handle date and time operations.
## We've also used string streams to convert
